I presented our paper <strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.21437/Interspeech.2022-146" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cross-Cultural Comparison of Gradient Emotion Perception: Human vs. Alexa TTS Voices</a></strong> authored with <strong>Michelle Cohn</strong> (UC Davis, USA), <strong>Georgia Zellou</strong> (UC Davis, USA), and <strong>Bernd Möbius</strong> (Saarland University, Germany) <i>[lower right]</i>, chaired a session on <strong>Automatic Analysis of Paralinguistics</strong> with <strong>Slim Essid</strong> (Télécom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France) <i>[upper left]</i>, and was involved in various events organized by a fantastic new generation of <strong><a href="http://www.isca-students.org/sacweb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISCA-SAC</a></strong> <i>[lower left]</i>. We also had the pleasure of an impromptu meeting with some of our ISCA-SAC predecessors <i>[upper right]</i>.

Looking forward to <strong><a href="https://www.interspeech2023.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Interspeech 2023</a></strong> in Dublin. Come visit us in Ireland! &#127470;&#127466; &#127808;
