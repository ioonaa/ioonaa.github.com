Many thanks to <strong>SimPhon.Net<\strong> in cooperation with the Stuttgart Research Focus (SRF) <strong>Language and Cognition<\strong> 
for having us at their workhop on <strong>psycholinguistic, cognitive and neurolinguistic modeling in phonetics and phonology<\strong>.
We had a great time both during the scientific discussions and when exploring the beautifully situated University of Hohenheim.
