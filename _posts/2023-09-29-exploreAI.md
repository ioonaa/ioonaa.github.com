title: ADAPT ExploreAI @ European Researchers' Night
---

I was happy to support the <a href="https://www.adaptcentre.ie/explore-ai//" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ADAPT ExploreAI</strong></a>
exhibition in the Douglas Hyde Gallery at Trinity College Dublin tonight. 
In the context of the <strong>European Researchers' Night</strong>, ADAPT researchers showcased cutting edge research on artificial intelligence (AI). I represented the ADAPT Gender, Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (GEDI) committee helping to make sure that the event was accessible to all.
