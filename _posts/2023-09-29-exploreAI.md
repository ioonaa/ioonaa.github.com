title: ADAPT #ExploreAI @ European Researchers' Night
---

I was happy to support the <a href="https://www.adaptcentre.ie/explore-ai//" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ADAPT #ExploreAI</strong></a>
exhibition in the Douglas Hyde Gallery at Trinity College Dublin tonight. 
In the context of the European Researchers' Night, ADAPT researchers showcased cutting edge research on artificial intelligence. I represented the ADAPT
Gender, Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion committee making sure that the event was accessible to all.
