title: UK Speech 2023 (June 14-15, 2023)
---

I had a fabulous time attending <a href="https://ukspeech2023.sheffield.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>UK Speech 2023</strong></a> from June 14-15, 2023, at the <strong>University of Sheffield</strong> in the UK, and presenting some ongoing work exploring 
prosody in referential communication with human and computer partners.

Particularly happy that the conference will be renamed <strong>UK and Ireland Speech</strong> starting next year to reflect the contributions of Irish 
researchers to the speech technology community in the British Isles. &#128154; &#127470;&#127466;
