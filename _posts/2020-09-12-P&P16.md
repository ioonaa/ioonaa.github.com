The online version of P&amp;P was a great success! The organizers have shown that it is possible to create real conference flair online 
by choosing the right <a href="https://gather.town/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">platform</a> and sending each participant a coffee break kit &#127850; &#9749; in advance.
Thanks a lot to <strong>Angelika Braun</strong>, <strong>Sophia FÃ¼nfgeld</strong>, <strong>Peter Knopp</strong>, <strong>Judith Manzoni-Luxenburger</strong>,
and their team at the <strong>University of Trier</strong>.
