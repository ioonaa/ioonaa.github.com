title: BlackboxNLP 2024 (November 15, 2024)
---

It has been a while since I joined a conference online.* For <a href="https://blackboxnlp.github.io/" target="_blank" 
rel="noopener"><strong>BlackboxNLP</strong></a> &#11035;, a workshop of <i>Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing</i>
(EMNLP), we decided not to travel to Miami, but to give the online option a try. Together with my colleague <strong>Erfan A. Shams</strong>, we were happy to present our paper <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2024.blackboxnlp-1.16.pdf" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uncovering Syllable Constituents in the Self-Attention-Based Speech Representations of Whisper</a> in the EMNLP space on <a href="https://www.gather.town//" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gather</a>.

<small><i>*Offering an online option for conferences provides researchers who are unable to travel with the valuable opportunity to publish their work. In most cases, however, this falls short of the richness and engagement of in-person participation. As a community, we must continue to explore effective alternatives that better capture the essence of the in-person conference experience. An online option alone is not a solution to the fact that the careers of many researchers are obstructed by issues such as unsuccessful visa applications. Those of us who are not affected must remember the privilege of unrestricted travel&#10071;</small></i>
