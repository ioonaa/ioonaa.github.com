It has been a while since I joined a conference online. For <a href="https://blackboxnlp.github.io/" target="_blank" 
rel="noopener"><strong>BlackboxNLP</strong></a> &mdash; a workshop of <i>Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing</i>
(EMNLP) &mdash; we gave the online option a try and presented <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2024.blackboxnlp-1.16.pdf" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uncovering Syllable Constituents in the Self-Attention-Based Speech Representations of Whisper</a>
together with my UCD colleague <strong>Erfan A. Shams</strong>.
