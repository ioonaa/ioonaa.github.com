It has been a while since I joined a conference online. For <a href="https://blackboxnlp.github.io/" target="_blank" 
rel="noopener"><strong>BlackboxNLP</strong></a>, a workshop of <i>Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing</i>
(EMNLP), we gave the online option a try and presented our paper <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2024.blackboxnlp-1.16.pdf" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uncovering Syllable Constituents in the Self-Attention-Based Speech Representations of Whisper</a>
together with my colleague <strong>Erfan A. Shams</strong> in the EMNLP space on <a href="https://www.gather.town//" target="_blank" 
rel="noopener">Gather</a>.
