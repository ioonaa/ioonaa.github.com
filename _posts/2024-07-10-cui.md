title: VUI Partner Models for German &#127465;&#127466; and Japanese &#127471;&#127477; Users
---

Today, we presented our work on assessing partner models for voice user interfaces (VUIs) at the <a href="https://cui.acm.org/2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ACM Conference
on Conversational User Interfaces in Luxembourg</strong></a>. If you work with German or Japanese speakers in human-computer interaction and want to assess how competent and reliable, human-like, and flexible they perceive VUIs to be, please consider using our translated versions of the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3640794.3665537" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Partner Modelling Questionnaire</strong></a>!
