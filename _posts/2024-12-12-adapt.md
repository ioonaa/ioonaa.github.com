Together with my colleagues Beyza Yaman, Esther Murphy, Brendan Spillane, and Erfan Shams, we received a recognition as <strong>Education & Public Engagement (EPE) Champions</strong> by ADAPT director John Kelleher.

<blockquote>EPE champions are individual team members who lead, or significantly contribute to, the development and/or delivery of EPE strategy and activities. These champions not only play a pivotal role in the creation and delivery of EPE strategies and initiatives, but they also inspire and empower their peers to engage actively.</blockquote>
