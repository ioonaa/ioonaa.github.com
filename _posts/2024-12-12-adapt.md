Together with my colleagues Beyza Yaman, Esther Murphy, Brendan Spillane, and Erfan Shams, we received a recognition as <strong>Education & Public Engagement (EPE) Champions</strong> by ADAPT director John Kelleher.

<blockquote><i>ADAPT EPE champions are individual team members who lead, or significantly contribute to, the development and/or delivery of EPE strategy and activities. These champions not only play a pivotal role in the creation and delivery of EPE strategies and initiatives, but they also inspire and empower their peers to engage actively.</i></blockquote>

I was further shortlisted for the <strong>Gender, Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (GEDI) Recognition Award</strong>!

<blockquote><i>The ADAPT GEDI Recognition Award honours significant contributions made to promote equality, diversity, and inclusion within ADAPT. This includes advancements in accessibility and inclusivity across workplace activities, training, community engagement, research innovations, communication, or other aspects of ADAPTâ€™s work.</i></blockquote>

Absolutely delighted to be an active member of ADAPT, beyond the research activities! &#127799;
