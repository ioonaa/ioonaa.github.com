title: Forensic Linguistics (July 22-26, 2018)
---

Happy to have joined the <strong>summer school on <em>Forensic Linguistics</em></strong> held for the first time 
on July 22-26, 2018 at the University of Cologne, Germany and organized by the <strong>Student Council for Linguistics and Phonetics</strong> of the latter. The short course focused on authorship profiling and attribution, discourse analysis, as well as language and meaning. It was led by <strong>Isabel Picornell</strong> (QED Limited), <strong>Ria Perkins</strong> (Hapax Consulting Ltd &amp; Aston University), and <strong>Nicci MacLeod</strong> (Aston University).
