title: GAM Workshop (May 10-14, 2021)
---

In the context of <strong>STEP 2021</strong> (Spring Training in Experimental Psycholinguistics) 
organized by the <strong>Centre for Comparative Psycholinguistics</strong> 
at the <strong>University of Alberta</strong> in Edmonton/Canada,
I had the pleasure to participate in the workshop on data analysis with the generalized additive model (GAM)
held by <strong>Harald Baayen</strong>, <strong>Yu-Ying Chuang</strong> (both University of TÃ¼bingen), 
and <strong>Peter Hendrix</strong>  (Tilburg University).

This was an excellent introduction to the topic, which fortunately even used examples from Phonetics. Terrific! &#128175;
Thank you very much!
