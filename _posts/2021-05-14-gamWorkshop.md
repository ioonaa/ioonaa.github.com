In the context of <strong>STEP 2021</strong> (Spring Training in Experimental Psycholinguistics) 
organized by the <strong>Centre for Comparative Psycholinguistics</strong> 
at the <strong>University of Alberta</strong> in Edmonton/Canada,
I had the pleasure to participate in the workshop on data analysis with the generalized additive model
held by <strong>Harald Baayen</strong>, <strong>Yu-Ying Chuang</strong> (both University of TÃ¼bingen), 
and <strong>Peter Hendrix</strong>  (Tilburg University).
