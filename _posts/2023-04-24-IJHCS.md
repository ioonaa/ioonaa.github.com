We are happy to announce that our article 
<strong>Audience Design and Egocentrism in Reference Production during Human-Computer Dialogue</strong> 
was published in the <strong>International Journal of Human-Computer Studies</strong> 
and is available 
<strong><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581923000678" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online</a></strong>.

The article compares the level of allocentric and egocentric speech production in human-human dialogue (HHD) and human-computer dialogue (HCD). We find 
that the role the computer partner occupies in the dialogue (i.e., whether it is seen more as a tool or as a dialogue partner) can affect how allocentric 
and egocentric users behave during the interaction. A more tool-like perception of the computer partner leads to increased egocentric behaviour on the 
part of the user, while perceiving the computer partner as dialogue partner leads to similar levels of allocentric and egocentric behaviour in HCD as 
in HHD.
