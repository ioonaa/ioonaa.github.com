title: Announcing Speech Pitch &#128483;

<blockquote>
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/isca-sac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speech Pitch</a></strong>
is ISCA-SAC's <a href="#section1">[1]</a> new podcast. 
Throughout the episodes, we will interview different guests, mostly from the speech community, in an informal setting. 
We want to get to know their work, their stories and their ideas for the future.
This podcast is hosted by PhD students in speech, with no experience in podcasts, 
but with the hope that it can bring the students and the entire speech community closer together, 
especially in pandemic times where we lack presencial conferences and other social interactions. 
We will try to have a new episode every 2 or 3 months. We hope you enjoy listening to it, and stay tuned!
