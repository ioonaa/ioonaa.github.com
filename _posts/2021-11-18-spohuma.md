I had the pleasure of organizing the <strong><a href="https://www.frias.uni-freiburg.de/de/veranstaltungen/nachwuchskonferenzen/SpoHuMa21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FRIAS Junior Researcher Conference - Human Perspectives on Spoken Human-Machine Interaction (SpoHuMa21)</a></strong> 
together with <strong>Sarah Warchhold</strong> (University of Freiburg), <strong>Daniel Duran</strong> (ZAS Berlin), and <strong>Eran Raveh</strong> (Hyro AI). 
The conference was supported by the <strong>Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies (FRIAS)</strong> â€“ special thanks to <strong>Kyra Vogt</strong> and <strong>Attilio Ferrarese</strong>!

<strong>SpoHuMa21</strong> featured submitted talks by young researchers, invited talks by <strong>Michelle Cohn</strong> (University of California, Davis, USA), <strong>Friederike Eyssel</strong> (Bielefeld University, Germany), <strong>Roger K. Moore</strong> (University of Sheffield, UK), <strong>Catharine Oertel</strong> (Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands), and <strong>Karola Pitsch</strong> (University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany), as well as various interactive discussion sessions.

We had a great time discussing spoken human-machine interaction from many different angles! &#128483; &#129302;
