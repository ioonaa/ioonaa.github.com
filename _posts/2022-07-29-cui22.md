It was great to be back in Glasgow for the <strong><a href="https://www.conversationaluserinterfaces.org/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conversational User Interfaces (CUI)</a></strong> conference 2022!
Organized at the <strong>University of Strathclyde</strong> and the <strong>University of Glasgow</strong>, CUI offered three really exciting conference days!

In their keynote talks, <strong>Jane Stuart-Smith</strong> (University of Glasgow) talked about how CUIs may be able to become socially-aware if sociolinguistic theory is considered in their development.
<strong>Cathy Pearl</strong> (Google), <strong>Saul Albert</strong> (Loughborough University), and <strong>Elizabeth Stokoe</strong> (Loughborough University) reflected on what insights from conversation analysis can, should, and should not be leveraged in conversation design for CUIs.
