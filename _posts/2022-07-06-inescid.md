title: Talk at INESC-ID
---

Today I was a guest at <strong><a href="https://www.inesc-id.pt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INESC-ID</a></strong> in Lisbon/Portugal.
I had the pleasure of getting to know the <strong>Human Language Technologies</strong> group and presenting my work.
Thank you very much for the invitation, Helena Moniz, Alberto Abad, and Isabel Trancoso! &#9728;&#65039;

I was also happy to get a glimpse into the work of <strong><a href="https://www.voiceinteraction.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VoiceInteraction</a></strong>. 
Their offices feature a very nice view over the city, including the stadiums of <em>Benfica</em> and <em>Sporting</em>! &#9917;
