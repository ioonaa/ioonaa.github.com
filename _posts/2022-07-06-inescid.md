title: Talk at INESC-ID
---

Today I was a guest at <strong><a href="https://www.inesc-id.pt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INESC-ID</a></strong> in Lisbon/Portugal.
I had the pleasure of getting to know the <strong>Human Language Technologies</strong> group and presenting my work.
Thank you very much for the invitation, Helena Moniz, Alberto Abad, and Isabel Trancoso!
