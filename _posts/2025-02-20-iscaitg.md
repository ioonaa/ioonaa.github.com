title: ISCA/ITG Workshop on Diversity in Large Speech and Language Models
---

The workshop took place at <strong>Humboldt University of Berlin</strong> and set out to address topics such as:
 <ul>
  <li><strong>User diversity:</strong> Which aspects of human speech and language production affect the performance of large language models (LLMs)?</li>
  <li><strong>Language use:</strong> How are LLMs able to cope with different languages, dialects, and sociolects? How do they deal with code switching?</li>
  <li><strong>Human adaptation:</strong> How does the use of LLMs affect language comprehension and production in humans? Which alignment effects occur, and in which time spans?</li>
  <li><strong>Model adaptation:</strong> How do models need to be designed to cope with speech and language diversity? How do training and finetuning affect model performance?</li>
  <li><strong>Inclusion:</strong> What data and technologies are necessary to better cope with diversity in LLMs?</li>
 </ul> 
 
With my colleague <strong>Erfan Amirzadeh Shams</strong>, we presented our work on 
<strong>How Transformer-based ASR Models Handle Diverse Signal Perturbations 
at the Segmental Level</strong>.
I also participated in a panel discussion on future research directions that tackle 
diversity issues in LLMs. 
And we concluded our trip with a concert at the Berliner Philhamronie. &#127926;
