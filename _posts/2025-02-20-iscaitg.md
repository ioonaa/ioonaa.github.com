title: ISCA/ITG Workshop on Diversity in Large Speech and Language Models (LSLMs)
---

The workshop took place at <strong>Humboldt University of Berlin</strong> and set out to address topics such as:
 <ul>
  <li><strong>User diversity:</strong> Which aspects of human speech and language production affect the performance of LSLMs?</li>
  <li><strong>Language use:</strong> How are LSLMs able to cope with different languages, dialects, and sociolects? How do they deal with code switching?</li>
  <li><strong>Human adaptation:</strong> How does the use of LSLMs affect language comprehension and production? Which alignment effects occur, and in which time spans?</li>
  <li><strong>Model adaptation:</strong> How do LSLMs need to be designed to cope with speech and language diversity? How do training and finetuning affect performance?</li>
  <li><strong>Inclusion:</strong> What data and technologies are necessary to better cope with diversity in LSLMs?</li>
 </ul> 
 
With my colleague <strong>Erfan Amirzadeh Shams</strong>, we presented our work on 
<strong>How Transformer-based ASR Models Handle Diverse Signal Perturbations 
at the Segmental Level</strong>.
Together with <strong>Dorothea Kolossa</strong> (TU Berlin), <strong>Georg Rehm</strong> (DFKI), and <strong>Pierre Zweigenbaum</strong> (LISN), I participated in a panel discussion on future research directions that tackle diversity issues in LSLMs, which was moderated by
<strong>Pia Knoeferle</strong> (HU Berlin) and <strong>Sebastian Möller</strong> (TU Berlin).
And we concluded our trip with a concert at the Berliner Philharmonie. &#127926;
