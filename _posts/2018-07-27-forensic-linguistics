title: Forensic Linguistics (July 22-26, 2018)
---

Happy to have joined the summer school on <strong>Forensic Linguistics</strong> held for the first time 
on July 22-26, 2018 at the University of Cologne, Germany and organized by the Student Council for Linguistics and Phonetics 
of the latter. The short course focused on authorship profiling and attribution; discourse analysis; and language and meaning.
