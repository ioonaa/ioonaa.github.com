We had a great <strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yfrsw-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Young Female Researchers in Speech Science and Technology workshop (YFRSW)</a></strong> today at <strong>Inha University</strong> in Incheon/Korea.
Thank you very much to my co-chairs <strong>Meg Zellers</strong> (University of Kiel, Germany) and <strong>Esther Klabbers</strong> (ReadSpeaker, USA), and the YFRSW 2022 organizing committee â€“ especially <strong>Bowon Lee</strong> (Inha University, Korea)!

Our workshop participants presented their project work, joined mentoring and panel session to discuss their questions, and subsequently attended Interspeech 2022. What a great opportunity, made possible by our sponsors and all mentors and panelists participating in the event. Thanks, everyone!
