We had a great <strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yfrsw-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Young Female Researchers in Speech Science and Technology workshop (YFRSW)</a></strong> today at <strong>Inha University</strong> in Incheon/Korea.
Thank you very much to my co-chairs <strong>Meg Zellers</strong> (University of Kiel, Germany) and <strong>Esther Klabbers</strong> (ReadSpeaker, USA), and the YFRSW 2022 <em>organizing committee</em> â€“ especially <strong>Bowon Lee</strong> (Inha University, Korea)!

Our workshop participants presented their work, joined mentoring and panel sessions to discuss their questions, and subsequently attended <strong><a href="https://www.interspeech2022.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Interspeech 2022</a></strong>. What a great opportunity, made possible by our <em>sponsors</em>, and all <em>mentors</em> and <em>panelists</em> participating in the event. <strong>Thanks, everyone!</strong> &#10084;
