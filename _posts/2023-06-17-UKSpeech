title: UK Speech 2023 (June 14-15, 2023)
---

I had a fabulous time attending <strong>UK Speech</strong> at the <strong>University of Sheffield</strong> and presenting some ongoing work exploring 
prosody in referential communication with human and computer partners.

Particularly happy that the conference will be renamed <strong>UK and Ireland Speech</strong> starting next year to reflect the contributions of Irish 
researchers to the speech technology community in the British Isles.
