I presented our work on <strong>Tracing Phonetic Features in Automatic Speech Recognition Models</strong>
in the joint colloqium of the phonetics and corpus linguistics groups at Humboldt University of Berlin.
Thank you for hosting me, <strong>Tine Mooshammer</strong>, <strong>Malte Belz</strong>, 
and <strong>Sarah Wesolek</strong>!

If you are planning a trip to Berlin, there surely is no shortage of activites. 
I can recommend booking a free tour of the <strong>Reichstag</strong> for a behind-the-scenes 
perspective on German politics &#x1F3DB;, taking the bus to Dahlem to enjoy expressionist art at 
the <strong>Brücke Museum</strong> &#x1F3A8;, and strolling through the city with open eyes to discover gems like the <strong>Yellow Man</strong> mural by Brasilian street artis Os Gêmeos.
