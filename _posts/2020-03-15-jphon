The article investigates phonetic accommodation of German native speakers in interaction with the simulated spoken dialog system Mirabella. 
Two versions of Mirabella are compared: one uses pre-recorded speech and the other synthesized speech. 
In both conditions, speakers converge to Mirabella regarding the intonation of wh-questions and one of two investigated allophonic contrasts.
