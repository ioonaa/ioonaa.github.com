Yesterday the <strong>Workshop for Young Female Researchers in Speech Science & Technology (YFRSW)</strong> took place as a satellite event of <strong>Interspeech 2021</strong>. A total of 21 undergraduate and master's students presented their projects in the field of speech science and technology. 
Thank you for your participation and the great presentations!

I would also like to highlight our doctoral student panel, consisting of <strong>Carol Figueroa</strong> (Furhat Robotics), <strong>Omnia Ibrahim</strong> (Saarland University), <strong>Mariana Julião</strong> (INESC-ID / IST / Lisbon University), and <strong>Maria Joana Correia</strong> (Spotify), who answered our attendees' questions much dedication.
Thank you so much for sharing your experience!
