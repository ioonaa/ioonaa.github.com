title: Accommodation Workshop (December 13, 2018)
---

The <strong>Workshop on Accommodation in Speech Communication</strong> organized by Elisa Pellegrino and Volker Dellwo for the <strong>University Research Priority Program <em>Language and Space</em></strong> at the University of Zurich was a unique opportunity to discuss and exchange ideas among the accommodation community. We heard inspiring invited talks by <strong>Rivka Levitan</strong> (Brooklyn College CUNY), <strong>Jennifer Pardo</strong> (Montclair State University), and <strong>Antje Schweitzer</strong> (Stuttgart University). 
Our talk was part of the session on <strong>accommodation in human-machine interactions</strong> together with contributions by Rivka Levitan, Štefan Beňuš as well as Petra Jaecks and Karoline Malchus.
