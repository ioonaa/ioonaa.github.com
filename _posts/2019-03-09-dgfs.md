The 41st Annual Conference of the German Linguistic Society (DGfS) took place at the University of Bremen from March 6th to 8th.
We had the pleasure to contribute to <strong>AG6: Phonetic Contrast and Phonemic Opposition<\strong> successfully organized by 
<strong>Felicitas Kleber<\strong> (University of Munich), <strong>Stefanie Jannedy<\strong> (ZAS Berlin), 
and <strong>Melanie Weirich<\strong> (University of Jena).
The invited talk by <strong>Andrew Wedel<\strong> (University of Arizona) discussed how the optimization for lexical information
transmission shapes systems of phonological contrast.
