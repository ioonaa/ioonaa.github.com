Four years after the last <strong>International Congress of Phonetic Sciences</strong> in Glasgow, it was about time for the 19th edition! This year about 900 Phoneticians gathered at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre, Australia.
The main areas covered by ICPhS are speech production, speech acoustics, speech perception, speech prosody, sound change, phonology, sociophonetics, language typology, first and second language acquisition, forensic phonetics, speaking styles, voice quality, clinical phonetics, and speech technology.
We had the pleasure to present our paper <a href="https://assta.org/proceedings/ICPhS2019/papers/ICPhS_1524.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>A Wizard-of-Oz Experiment to Study Phonetic Accommodation in Human-Computer Interaction</strong></a>.
We had a great time Down Under and we are looking forward to ICPhS 2023 at Charles University in Prague!
