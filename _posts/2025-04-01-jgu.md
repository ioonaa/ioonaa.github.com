After three fabulous years with ADAPT in Dublin &#128154;, I am happy to share that I am starting a new postdoc position at 
<strong><a href="https://www.uni-mainz.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johannes Gutenberg University (JGU) Mainz</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.uni-saarland.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saarland University, Saarbrücken</a></strong>.
I will investigate the intonational phonology of Judeo-Spanish varieties spoken in Bulgaria &#127463;&#127468;
with <strong><a href="https://www.romanistik.uni-mainz.de/gabriel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Christoph Gabriel</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~andreeva/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Bistra Andreeva</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://www.uni-regensburg.de/sprache-literatur-kultur/forum-mehrsprachigkeit-regionalitaet/fomur/professur-fuer-mehrsprachigkeit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Jonas Grünke</a></strong>. 

Judeo-Spanish, also known as Ladino, is a heritage language spoken by the descendants of the
Sephardic Jews who were expelled in 1492 from the Iberian Peninsula.
One main area of settlement was the Ottoman Empire and its successor states such as Turkey, Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria.
Today, fewer than 30 Sephardim living in Bulgaria can still be considered native speakers of Bulgarian Judeo‑Spanish, making this research project an essential endeavor to preserve this important cultural heritage.
