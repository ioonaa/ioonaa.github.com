Happy to share that I am starting a new postdoc position at 
<strong><a href="https://www.ucd.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johannes Gutenberg University (JGU) Mainz</a></strong>.
I will investigate the intonational phonology of Judeo-Spanish varieties spoken in Bulgaria &#127463;&#127468;
with <strong><a href="https://www.romanistik.uni-mainz.de/gabriel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Christoph Gabriel</a></strong>.
This is a joint project with <strong><a href="https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~andreeva/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Bistra Andreeva</a></strong>
at Saarland University, Saarbrücken. 

Judeo-Spanish, also known as Ladino, is a heritage language spoken by the descendants of the
Sephardic Jews who were expelled in 1492 from the Iberian Peninsula.
One main area of settlement was the Ottoman Empire and its successor states such as Greece, Turkey, Serbia, and Bulgaria.
Today, less than 30 Sephardim living in Bulgaria, born between the 1920s and the 1960s, can be considered native speakers of Bulgarian Judeo‑Spanish.
