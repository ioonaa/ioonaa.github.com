I am very happy to have contributed to another successful edition of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yfrsw-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Young Female* Researchers in Speech Workshop (YFRSW).</strong></a> This year, the workshop was held on the beautiful Greek island of Kos. We had the pleasure of welcoming our participants at the <strong>2nd Lyceum of Kos</strong>. 	&#127468;&#127479; &#127965; &#9728;&#65039;
