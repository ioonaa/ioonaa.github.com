I am very happy to have contributed to another successful edition of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yfrsw-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Young Female* Researchers in Speech Workshop (YFRSW).</strong></a> This year, the workshop was held on the beautiful Greek island of Kos. We had the pleasure of welcoming our participants at the <strong>2nd Lyceum of Kos</strong>. &#127468; &#127479; &#127965; &#57418;

This wouldn't have been possible without my fantatic co-chairs <strong>Leda Sari</strong> (Meta AI, USA) and <strong>Georgia Maniati</strong> (Samsung Electronics / Innoetics, Greece),
as well as all members of the organizing committee: <strong>Ayushi Pandey</strong> (Trinity College Dublin, Ireland), <strong>Johannah O'Mahony</strong> 
(University of Edinburgh, UK), <strong>Pamir Gogoi</strong> (Living Tongues Institute of Endangered Languages, USA), and <strong>Sarenne Wallbridge</strong> 
(University of Edinburgh, UK)!
