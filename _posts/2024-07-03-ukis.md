Once again, <a href="https://ukis2024.eng.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>UK and Ireland Speech (UKIS)</strong></a> 
has proven to be a fantastic venue to discuss all aspects of speech.
With international conferences ever increasing in size, these smaller gatherings are so important for proper exchange and thorough networking. 
Thank you very much to <strong>Kate Knill</strong> and her team for hosting us at the <strong>University of Cambridge</strong> this year! 
We presented our work on querying speech embeddings for phonetic information â€“ our aim is to make deep-learned ASR models accessible to linguistic research. 
Please see the <a href="http://ukis2024.eng.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ukis2024-AbstractBook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Book of Abstracts</strong></a> for the full programm of UKIS 2024.
