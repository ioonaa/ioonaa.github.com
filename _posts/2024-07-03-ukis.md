title: UKIS 2024 (July 1-2, 2024)
---

Once again, <a href="https://ukis2024.eng.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>UK and Ireland Speech (UKIS)</strong></a> has proven to be a fantastic venue to discuss all aspects of speech.
With international conferences ever increasing in size, these local events are so important for proper exchange and thorough networking. 
Many thanks to <strong>Kate Knill</strong> and her team for hosting us at the <strong>University of Cambridge</strong> this year! 
We presented our work on querying speech embeddings for phonetic information with the aim of making deep-learned speech recognition models accessible to linguistic research. 
Please also find presentations from our group in the special session on <em>Leveraging Large Language Models and Contextual Features for Phonetic Analysis</em> at <a href="https://interspeech2024.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Interspeech 2024</strong></a>!

The full programme of UKIS 2024 can be accessed via the <a href="http://ukis2024.eng.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ukis2024-AbstractBook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Book of Abstracts</strong></a>.
