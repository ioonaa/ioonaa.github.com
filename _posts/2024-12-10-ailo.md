title: AILO Workshop in Donnybrook
---

Leading a workshop preparing students for the <strong>All Ireland Linguistics Olympiad (AILO)</strong> is always an end-of-year highlight.
This year, I visited Muckross Park College in Dublin. The workshop was also joined by students from Oatlands College, Harold's Cross Educate Together Secondary School, Catholic University School, and The Teresian School. 

The group did an amazing job at solving puzzles on three different languages that were unkown to them: <strong>Permyak</strong>, spoken by around 60k people in the north-eastern part of European Russia, <strong>Lalana Chinantec</strong>, spoken by approximately 10k people in the Oaxaca region of Mexico, and <strong>Umbrian</strong>, an extinct Italic language formerly spoken in the ancient Italian region of Umbria. 

In July of 2025, the <strong>international final</strong> of AILO will take place in Taipei, Taiwan. 
But first, the 100 most successful puzzle solvers across Ireland will compete in the <strong>national final</strong> in March at <strong>Dublin City University</strong>.

I hope to see some of the students I met at the national finals - best of luck! &#127808; &#128221;
