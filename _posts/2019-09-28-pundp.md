title: P&amp;P 15 (September 25-27, 2019)
---

The 15<sup>th</sup> edition of <b>Phonetik und Phonologie im deutschsprachigen Raum</b> took place at the Heinrich-Heine-University in Düsseldorf. 
The conference continues to grow, which is why we had the first P&amp;P with two parallel tracks this year.
Invited talks were given by <b>Caroline Féry</b> (Goethe University Frankfurt): <i>The role of phonology in evolution of language</i> and <b>Vsevolod Kapatsinski</b> (University of Oregon): <i>Mechanisms of phonological learning</i>.
Many thanks to the Düsseldorf team for the wonderfully organized conference!
