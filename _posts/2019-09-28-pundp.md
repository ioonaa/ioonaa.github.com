title: P&amp;P 15 (September 25-27, 2019)
---

The 15<sup>th</sup> edition of <q>Phonetik und Phonologie im deutschsprachigen Raum</q> took place at the Heinrich-Heine-Universität in Düsseldorf. 
The conference continues to grow, which is why we had the first P&amp;P with two parallel tracks this year.
Invited talks were given by Caroline Féry (Goethe-Universität Frankfurt): <q>The role of phonology in evolution of language</q> and Vsevolod Kapatsinski (University of Oregon): <q>Mechanisms of phonological learning</q>.
Many thanks to the Düsseldorf team for the wonderfully organized conference!
