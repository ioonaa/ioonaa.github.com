The 15<sup>th</sup> edition of <q>Phonetik und Phonologie im deutschsprachigen Raum</q> took place at the Heinrich-Heine-University in Düsseldorf. 
The conference continues to grow, which is why we had the first P&amp;P with two parallel tracks this year.
Many thanks to the Düsseldorf team for the wonderfully organized conference!
