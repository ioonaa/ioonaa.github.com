Some take-aways to remember:
<ul>
<li><q>Learn to think independently and critically during your PhD.</q></li>
<li><q>Keep in touch with your mentors!</q></li>
<li><q>Do not compare your thesis with the top doctoral theses in your field and try at all costs to achieve the same level.</q></li>
<li><q>A good way to start the career? Organize a challenge at Interspeech!</q></li>
<li><q>Your career is not a sprint, it's a marathon.</q></li>
<li><q>Sometimes the much-praised freedom in the academic world seems a bit of a fantasy.</q></li>
<li><q>In academia it is easier to start collaborations - more restrictions in industry.</q></li>
<li><q>Don't forget to invest time in writing journal papers.</q></li>
<li><q>In the future, we must take ethical aspects such as data protection, fairness and accountability into account in our research.</q></li>
</ul>
