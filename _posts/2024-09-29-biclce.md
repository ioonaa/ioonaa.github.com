title: BICLCE 2024 (September 26-28, 2024)

I was delighted to attend the <a href="https://web.ua.es/es/biclce2024/presentacion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Biennial International Conference on the Linguistics of Contemporary English</strong></a> for the first time this year! The meeting was expertly hosted by the University of Alicante in the Valencian region of Spain.

I presented our work on querying the embeddings of automatic speech recognition (ASR) for phonetic information in the workshop on <i><strong>Corpus Phonology: Current Approaches and Future Directions</strong></i> which was organized by <strong>Philipp Meer</strong> and <strong>Ulrike Gut</strong> from the University of MÃ¼nster in Germany.

Other topics of the workshop included down-sampling strategies in corpus phonology, the performance of the ASR model <i>Whisper</i> on sociolinguistic data sets, and work on different varieties of English (Australian, New Zealand, Nigerian, and Scottish Standard English).
