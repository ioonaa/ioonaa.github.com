Under the motto <strong>Towards the New Era of Speech Understanding</strong>, researchers gathered for this year's 
<strong>IEEE Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding (ASRU)</strong> workshop at the Hyatt Regency Waikiki Beach Resort and Spa 
in Honolulu, Hawaii.

Together with Suyoun Kim (Amazon, USA), we took the role of Student and Volunteer Chairs. We had the pleasure of working 
with a highly motivated group of students from the University of Hawai at Manoa who volunteered to help running a smooth conference.
We also able to match 23 mentor-mentee pairs who met up during the conference. Mentees reported gaining more clarity about 
research and career, while mentors reported gaining fresh perspectives from early-career researchers. Some impressions from these
meet-ups are provided below.

We thank everyone who made this ASRU a success! 
It was fantastic working alongside the never tirign General Chairs, <strong>Bowon Lee</strong> (Inha University, Korea),
<strong>Kyu Jeong Han</strong> (Oracle, USA), and <strong>Chanwoo Kim</strong> (Korea University).
