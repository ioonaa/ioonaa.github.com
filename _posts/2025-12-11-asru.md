Under the motto <strong>Towards the New Era of Speech Understanding</strong>, this year's 
<strong>IEEE Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding (ASRU)</strong> workshop brought researchers together 
at the Hyatt Regency Waikiki Beach Resort and Spa in Honolulu, Hawaiʻi.

Together with <strong>Suyoun Kim</strong> (Amazon, USA), we had the exciting role of <strong>Student and Volunteer Chairs</strong> for the workshop. 
We had the pleasure of working with a group of highly motivated students from the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, who helped us make sure the conference ran seamlessly.
On top of that, we organized a mentoring event, bringing together early-career researchers and experienced mentors. Mentees shared that the meet-ups gave them valuable clarity on research directions and career paths, while mentors enjoyed fresh perspectives from the next generation of researchers. Some impressions from these meet-ups are shared below.

It was fantastic working alongside the tireless General Chairs, <strong>Bowon Lee</strong> (Inha University, Korea),
<strong>Kyu Jeong Han</strong> (Oracle, USA), and <strong>Chanwoo Kim</strong> (Korea University), whose dedication made the conference a success! Mahalo!
