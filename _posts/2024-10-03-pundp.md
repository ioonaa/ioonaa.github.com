The conference on phonetics and phonlogy in the German-speaking region (P&P) &mdash; <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/pundp2024/start" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Phonetik und Phonologie im deutschsprachigen Raum</strong></a> &mdash; was once again a fantastic
opportunity to catch up with colleagues. The team around <strong>Sven Grawunder</strong> did a great job hosting the meeting
at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg in Halle/Saale, Germany. &#128588;

I was delighted to present joint work with my former UCD Master's student <strong>Jiaman He</strong> on <i>The Influence of Visual 
Context on the Perception of Voice Assistant Gender</i>. This work explores whether listeners perceive Apple Siri's gender-neutral 
American English voice <i>Quinn</i> as neutral and if visual context influences this perception. &#128284; The full paper is to appear in the
conference proceedings. &#128210;
