title: AILO Workshop in Longford
---

To end the year in style, I had the pleasure to lead a workshop at Scoil Mhuire Longford in preparation for the <strong>All Ireland Linguistics Olympiad (AILO)</strong>.
Students from Longford and Roscommon came together to solve linguistic puzzles. Among others, we had a look at <strong>Pali</strong>, a literary language related to Sanskrit, the ancestor of the 
modern languages of North India such as Hindi, and <strong>Old Norse</strong>, the language of the Vikings, the ancestor of the North Germanic languages such as Icelandic and Swedish. 

The national final of AILO will take place at Dublin City University in March 2024, and the international final will take place in Brazil's capital Brasilia in July 2024.
Best of luck to all students who try out for the finals! Hope to see you in Dublin this March!
