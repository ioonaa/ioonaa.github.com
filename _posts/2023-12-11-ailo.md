title: AILO Workshop in Longford
---

At the end of the year, I had the pleasure to lead a workshop at Scoil Mhuire Longford in preparation for the <strong>All Ireland Linguistics Olympiad (AILO)</strong>.
Students from Longford and Roscommon came together to solve linguistic puzzles. Among others, we had a look at <strong>Pali</strong>, a literary language related to Sanskrit, ancestor of North Indian languages such as Hindi, and <strong>Old Norse</strong>, the language of the Vikings, ancestor of North Germanic languages such as Swedish. 

The <strong>national final</strong> of AILO will take place in March 2024 at <strong>Dublin City University</strong>, the <strong>international final</strong> in July 2024 in Brazil's capital <strong>Brasília</strong>. More information about AILO can be found <a href="https://ailo.adaptcentre.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>here</strong></a>.

Best of luck to all students who try out for the finals – hope to see you in Dublin this March! 	&#127808; &#128221;
