It wasn't that difficult to launch a website, after all... Thanks to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for the very convenient repository integration and free hosting, the guys at [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), as well as to [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo) for his great <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">Jekyll theme</a>.
