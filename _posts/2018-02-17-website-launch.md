It wasn't that difficult to launch a website, after all... Thanks to <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> for the very convenient repository integration and free hosting, the guys at <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, as well as to <a href="https://github.com/mdo" target="_blank">Mark Otto</a> for his great <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde" target="_blank">Jekyll theme</a>.
