title: Interspeech 2024 (September 1-5, 2024)
---

Two very different worlds collided at <a href="https://interspeech2024.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Interspeech</a> this year: speech science and all-inclusive tourism. &#128516; 
We had a very good time on Kos Island in Greece!

We presented recent work from the <strong>Berndsen Lab</strong> at University College Dublin:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2024/shams24_interspeech.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Are Articulatory Feature Overlaps Shrouded in Speech Embeddings?</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2024/masson24_interspeech.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PhoneViz: exploring alignments at a glance</a></li> 
  <li><a href="https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2024/english24_interspeech.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Searching for Structure: Appraising the Organisation of Speech Features in wav2vec 2.0 Embeddings</a></li> 
</ul>

I also had the pleasure of presenting joint work with with <strong>Bistra Andreeva</strong> (Saarland University, Germany) and <strong>Benjamin R. Cowan</strong> (University College Dublin, Ireland)
on <a href="https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2024/gessinger24_interspeech.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Use of Modifiers and f0 in Remote Referential Communication with Human and Computer Partners</a>.
