The proceedings of our conference about <strong>human perspectives on spoken human-machine interaction</strong> (HMI) are now available 
<strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.6094/UNIFR/223814" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online</a></strong>. 
&#128214; <em>#openaccess</em> &#128275;

The papers presented at SpoHuMa21 explore spoken HMI from various angles. 
The contributions by <strong>Ibrahim & Skantze</strong> and <strong>Sinha & Siegert</strong> examine how human speech in HMI changes depending 
on the addressee and what challenges are involved in understanding its variability. <strong>Allen</strong> and <strong>Leisten
& Rieser</strong> investigate another aspect of human speech, namely gender-based perception and behavior
differences, and how these may influence the attitude towards speaking devices. Various medical applications
that leverage spoken HMI are presented by <strong>Collins, Bevacqua, De Loor, & Querrec</strong>, <strong>Attas, Kellett,
Blackmore, & Christensen</strong>, and <strong>Pevy, Christensen, Walker, & Reuber</strong>. These include seizure
narration, emotion dimensions of speakers with anxiety disorders, and virtual medical assistance. Finally,
<strong>Honkalammi, Veivo, & Johansson</strong> and <strong>Chen, Liesenfeld, Li, & Yao</strong> deal with cooperative
aspects of spoken HMI, such as advice giving in learning processes and the effect of computer disfluency on
memory recall.

Many thanks to the authors for their contributions and, of course, to <strong>FRIAS</strong> (Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies) for having us!
