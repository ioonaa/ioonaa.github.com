title: Joining ADAPT GEDI Committee
---

This month, I joined the <strong>ADAPT Gender, Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (GEDI) Committee</strong> as a postdoctoral representative. 

In parallel with ADAPTâ€™s research mission, the GEDI Committee advises the centre on issues relating to inclusiveness, diversity and equal 
opportunities for all members. It works with the ADAPT management to create an open, sustainable, and community-focused culture that fosters 
next generation research.
