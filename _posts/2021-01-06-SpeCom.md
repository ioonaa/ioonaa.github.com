We are happy to announce that our article <strong>Phonetic Accommodation to Natural and Synthetic Voices: Behavior of Groups and Individuals in Speech Shadowing</strong> was published in <strong>Speech Communication</strong> and is available <strong><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167639320303095" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online</a></strong>. &#128214; <em>#openaccess</em> &#128275;

The article presents a comparison of phonetic accommodation to natural and synthetic voices when shadowing short sentences.
The study investigates a diverse set of features pertaining to different phonetic domains.
Natural and synthetic voices triggered accommodating behavior for several features.
Predominant pattern: convergence during the interaction followed by divergence after the interaction.
Individual participants converged to varying subsets of the examined features.
