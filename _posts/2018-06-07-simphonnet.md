Many thanks to <strong>SimPhon.Net</strong> in cooperation with the Stuttgart Research Focus (SRF) <strong>Language and Cognition</strong> 
for having us at the workhop on <strong>psycholinguistic, cognitive and neurolinguistic modeling in phonetics and phonology</strong>.
We had a great time both during the scientific discussions and when exploring the beautifully situated University of Hohenheim!
