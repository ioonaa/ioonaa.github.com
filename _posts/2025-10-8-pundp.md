title: P&P 2025 in Leipzig
---

This year's P&P conference took place at the beautiful Leipzig University Library, Bibliotheca Albertina. 
A great opportunity to discuss our work on <strong>Question Intonation in Bilingual Speakers of Bulgarian and Judeo-Spanish</strong> 
with the vibrant community of phoneticians and phonologists from the DACH+ region.
