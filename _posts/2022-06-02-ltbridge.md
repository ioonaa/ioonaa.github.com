The aim of the <strong><a href="https://lt-bridge.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LT-Bridge H2020 Project</a></strong> is to integrate Malta into European research and innovation efforts for AI-based language technologies. 
At the LT-Bridge summer school in Galway, representatives of the University of Malta, the German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), and various Dublin universities (DCU, TCD, UCD, TUD) came together to learn about topics like personalisation (Prof Owen Conlan, TCD), dialog systems and chatbots (Dr Emer Gilmartin, TCD), neural machine translation (Prof Mikel L. Forcada, University of Alicante), coreference resolution (Dr Yufang Hou, IBM Research/TU Darmstadt), and distributional semantics (Filip Klubicka, TUD), as well as a special session on research career development for early stage researchers.
