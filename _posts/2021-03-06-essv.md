title: ESSV (March 3-5, 2021)
---

The <strong>32th Konferenz Elektronische Sprachsignalverarbeitung (ESSV)</strong> was organized by <strong>Stefan Hillmann</strong>, <strong>Benjamin Weiss</strong>, <strong>Thilo Michael</strong>, <strong>Sebastian Möller</strong>, and their team at <strong>Technische Universität Berlin</strong>. It took place virtually, of course. We should think about awarding a prize for the most well-designed gatherTown environment - ESSV 2021 would be a strong contender! &#127942;

I particularly enjoyed the keynote talks by <strong>Elisabeth André</strong> (<em>Towards socially interactive agents with explanatory skills</em>) and <strong>David Schlangen</strong> (<em>All interaction is situated, all language is grounded: implications for the design of spoken dialogue systems</em>).

The <strong>Best Student Paper</strong> went to <strong>Anabell Hacker</strong> (TU Berlin) for her work <em>Alexa, who are you? – Analysing Alexa's, Cortana's and Siri's vocal personalityt</em>. Congratulations! &#128079; 

We presented joint work between <strong>Saarland University, Saarbrücken</strong> and <strong>Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznań</strong> on <em>Phonetic convergence evaluation based on fundamental frequency variability</em>.
