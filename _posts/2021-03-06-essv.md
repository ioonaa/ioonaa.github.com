title: ESSV (March 3-5, 2021)

The <strong>32th Konferenz Elektronische Sprachsignalverarbeitung (ESSV)</strong> was organized by <strong>Stefan Hillmann</strong>, <strong>Benjamin Weiss</strong>, <strong>Thilo Michael</strong>, <strong>Sebastian Möller</strong>, and their team at <strong>Technische Universität Berlin</strong>. It took place virtually, of course. We should think about awarding a prize for the most well-designed GatherTown environment - ESSV 2021 would be a strong contender!

I particularly enjoyed the keynote talks by <strong>Elisabeth André</strong> (<em>Towards Socially Interactive Agents with Explanatory Skills</em>) and <strong>David Schlangen</strong> (<em>All Interaction is Situated, All Language is Grounded: Implications for the Design of Spoken Dialogue Systems</em>).

We presented joint work between <strong>Saarland University, Saarbrücken</strong> and <strong>Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznań</strong> on <em>Phonetic convergence evaluation based on fundamental frequency variability</em>.
