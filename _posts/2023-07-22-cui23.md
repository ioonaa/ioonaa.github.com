title: CUI 2023 (July 19-21, 2023)
---

The <a href="https://cui.acm.org/2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ACM conference on Conversational User Interfaces (CUI) 2023</strong></a> took place from July 19â€“21, 2023, at the <strong>Eindhoven University
of Technology</strong> (TU/e) in the Netherlands.

I was delighted to witness our former UCD Master's student <strong>Sam Davern</strong> (now PhD student at Trinity College Dublin) presenting his thesis <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3571884.3604306" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Investigating the Usability of a Speech Agent-based Role-Playing Game</strong></a>. Very well done, Sam! &#128079;
