title: Visit at Hyro
---

Today I had the pleasure of visiting <strong><a href="https://www.hyro.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyro</a></strong> Tel Aviv. 
With members of the product and engineering teams we discussed speech-related phenomena and their relevance for conversational AI. Thank you for having me (<strong>Eran Raveh</strong>, <strong>Rotem Fisch</strong> et al)! &#128522; &#128075;
