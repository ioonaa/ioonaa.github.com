title: New study! &#127881; How visuals shape the way we perceive voice assistant gender
---

Most voice assistants still sound female – even when designed to be neutral? 

In our new study, <strong>The Influence of Visual Context on the Perception of Voice Assistant Gender</strong>, we explored how people perceive Apple Siri’s gender-neutral voice <em>Quinn</em>.
We found that listeners tended to rate Quinn as more female-sounding – especially when a female portrait was shown at the same time (even though unrelated to the task). This confirms that what we see can strongly influence what we hear, even with supposedly neutral voices.

Designing truly gender-neutral voice assistants isn’t just about the sound itself.
Our expecations and the visual context play a significant role as well.
