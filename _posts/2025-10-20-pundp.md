title: New study! &#127881; How visuals shape the way we perceive voice assistant gender
---

Most voice assistants still sound female â€“ even when designed to be neutral? ðŸ¤”

In our new study, <strong>The Influence of Visual Context on the Perception of Voice Assistant Gender</strong>, we explored how people perceive Apple Siriâ€™s gender-neutral voice <em>Quinn</em>.
We found that listeners tended to rate Quinn as more female-sounding â€“ especially when a female portrait was shown at the same time (even though it was unrelated to the task). This confirms that what we see ðŸ‘€ can strongly influence what we hear ðŸ‘‚, even with supposedly neutral voices.

Designing truly gender-neutral voice assistants isnâ€™t just about the sound itself â€” our expectations and the visual context play a powerful role too.
