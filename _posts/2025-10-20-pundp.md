title: New study! &#127881; How visuals shape the way we perceive voice assistant gender
---

Most voice assistants still sound female â€“ even when designed to be neutral? ðŸ¤”

In our new study, <strong>The Influence of Visual Context on the Perception of Voice Assistant Gender</strong>, we explored how people perceive Apple Siriâ€™s gender-neutral voice <em>Quinn</em>.
We found that listeners tended to rate <em>Quinn</em> as more female-sounding â€“ especially when a female portrait was shown at the same time (see Figure 1a). This confirms that what we see ðŸ‘€ can strongly influence what we hear ðŸ‘‚, even with supposedly neutral voices.

Designing truly gender-neutral voice assistants isnâ€™t just about the sound itself â€” our expectations and the visual context play a powerful role too.

We had the pleasure of presenting this work at P&P 2024 in Halle, Germany. Read the full paper in the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.25673/116710" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proceedings of P&P 2024</a>. <em>#openaccess</em> &#128275;
