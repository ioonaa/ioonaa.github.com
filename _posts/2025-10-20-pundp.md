title: New study: How visuals shape the way we hear voice assistants
---

Most voice assistants still sound female – even when designed to be neutral. 
In our new study, “The Influence of Visual Context on the Perception of Voice Assistant Gender,” 
we explored how people perceive Apple Siri’s gender-neutral voice “Quinn.”

We found that listeners tended to hear “Quinn” as more female – especially when the voice was 
paired with a female image. This shows that what we see can strongly influence what we hear, 
even with supposedly neutral voices.

Designing truly gender-neutral voice assistants isn’t just about the sound, but also about the 
visuals around them.
