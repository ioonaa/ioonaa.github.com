Today, I presented our Interspeech 2022 paper <strong>Cross-Cultural Comparison of Gradient Emotion Perception: Human vs. Alexa TTS Voices</strong> authored with Michelle Cohn, Georgia Zellou, and Bernd Möbius, in the <strong><a href="https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/multilinguality-and-language-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multilinguality and Language Technology</a></strong> group at DFKI/Saarbrücken. Thank you for having me!
