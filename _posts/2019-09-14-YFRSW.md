title: PhD Panel at YFRSW (September 14, 2019)
---
Today, I had the pleasure to be part of the PhD panel of this year's
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yfrsw-2019/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workshop for Young Female Researchers in Speech Science &amp; Technology (YFRSW)</a> which was held at Graz Technical University.
YFRSW aims to foster interest in research in our field in female undergraduate and masters students, 
who have not yet committed to getting a PhD.
The panel answered questions by the audience on how to get a PhD position (in different countries), how to get through a PhD 
while keeping a sane mind, and why to pursue a PhD in the first place.

We hope to have shared some helpful insight!

Thank you for organizing this great workshop, 
<strong>Catharine Oertel</strong>, <strong>Odette Scharenborg</strong> (both Delft University of Technology), 
<strong>Esther Klabbers</strong> (ReadSpeaker), and team!
