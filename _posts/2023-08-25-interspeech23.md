I presented our recent work on <strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.21437/Interspeech.2023-711" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cross-linguistic 
Emotion Perception in Human and TTS Voices</a></strong> in collaboration with <strong>Michelle Cohn</strong> (UC Davis, USA), 
<strong>Benjamin R. Cowan</strong> (University College Dublin, Ireland), <strong>Georgia Zellou</strong> (UC Davis, USA), and 
<strong>Bernd MÃ¶bius</strong> (Saarland University, Germany). 
I also co-chaired a session on <strong>Health-Related Speech Analysis</strong> with <strong>Corinne Fredouille</strong> 
(University of Avignon, France). An absolute pleasure to learn more about this area!
