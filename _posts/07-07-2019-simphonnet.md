Many thanks to <b>SimPhon.Net<\b> in cooperation with the Stuttgart Research Focus (SRF) <b>Language and Cognition<\b> 
for having us at their workhop on <b>psycholinguistic, cognitive and neurolinguistic modeling in phonetics and phonology<\b>.
We had a great time both during the scientific discussions and when exploring the beautifully situated University of Hohenheim.
