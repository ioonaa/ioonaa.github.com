In the course of my education as a phonetician, I was engaged in various fields of application. Having a background in Romance studies, I started with the phonetics of <strong>foreign language learning</strong>, continued in the area of <strong>forensic phonetics</strong>, and am now working on <strong>phonetic accommodation in human-computer interaction</strong>. As spoken dialog systems become a part of our daily lives, I believe it is imperative to further investigate the behavior of their human interlocutors in order to incorporate these findings into the development of the systems.

I am part of the <a href="http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/groups/WB/Phonetics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phonetics and Phonology</a> research group headed by <a href="http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~moebius/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Bernd Möbius</a>. Our group belongs to the <a href="https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Language Science and Technology</a> department at <a href="https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saarland University</a>, Saarbrücken.

I am working on the topic of <strong>phonetic accommodation of human interlocutors in the context of human-computer interaction</strong> within the <a href="https://ioonaa.github.io/chicproject/" >CHIC project</a> and recently defended my dissertation.
