In the course of my education as a phonetician, I was engaged in various fields of application. Having a background in Romance studies, I started with the phonetics of <strong>foreign language learning</strong>, continued in the area of <strong>forensic phonetics</strong>, and am now working on <strong>phonetic accommodation in human-computer interaction</strong>. As spoken dialogue systems are becoming a part of our daily life, it is imperative to further explore the behavior of their human interlocutor.


I am part of the [Phonetics and Phonology](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/groups/WB/Phonetics/) research group headed by [Prof. Dr. Bernd Möbius](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~moebius/). Our group belongs to the [Language Science and Technology](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst/home.html) department at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/nc/en/home.html), Saarbrücken.
