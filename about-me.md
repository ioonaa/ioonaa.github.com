In the course of my education as a phonetician, I was engaged in various fields of application. Having a background in Romance studies, I started with the phonetics of <strong>foreign language learning</strong>, continued in the area of <strong>forensic phonetics</strong>, and am now working on <strong>phonetic accommodation in human-computer interaction</strong>. As spoken dialog systems become a part of our daily lives, I believe it is imperative to further investigate the behavior of their human interlocutors in order to incorporate these findings into the development of the systems.

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.hci.ucd.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HCI@UCD group</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://people.ucd.ie/benjamin.cowan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assoc. Prof. Benjamin Cowan</a>. Our group belongs to the <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/ics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">School of Information and Communication Studies</a> at <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University College Dublin</a>. I am also affiliated with the <a href="https://www.adaptcentre.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADAPT Centre</a>.

Before that, I was part of the <a href="http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/groups/WB/Phonetics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phonetics and Phonology</a> research group headed by <a href="http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~moebius/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Bernd Möbius</a>. The group belongs to the <a href="https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Language Science and Technology</a> department at <a href="https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saarland University</a>, Saarbrücken. During this time, I wrote my doctoral thesis on phonetic accommodation of human interlocutors in the context of human-computer interaction, which I worked on as part of the <a href="https://ioonaa.github.io/chicproject/">CHIC project</a>.
