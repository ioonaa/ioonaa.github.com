I am a <a href="https://people.ucd.ie/iona.gessinger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">postdoctoral researcher</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://people.ucd.ie/julie.berndsen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Julie Berndsen</a> in the <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/cs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">School of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University College Dublin (UCD)</a>. I am also affiliated with the <a href="https://www.adaptcentre.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADAPT Centre for AI-Driven Digital Content Technology</a>.
Prior to my current position, I worked with <a href="https://people.ucd.ie/benjamin.cowan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assoc. Prof. Benjamin Cowan</a> in the <a href="https://www.hci.ucd.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HCI@UCD group</a> at the <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/ics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UCD School of Information and Communication Studies</a>.

My work focuses on the fine <strong>phonetic detail of spoken interaction</strong> between humans and computers with the aim of making this information usable for the further <strong>development of voice-activated digital assistants</strong>. In particular, I am researching accommodation phenomena and the perception of natural and synthetic voices by human users of such assistants.

I taught topics such as <strong>phonetics</strong>, <strong>speech science</strong>, and <strong>user-centered design</strong> at undergraduate and postgraduate level.

In the course of my education as a phonetician, I was engaged in various fields of application. Having a background in Romance studies (French and Portuguese), I started with the phonetics of <strong>foreign language learning</strong>, continued in the area of <strong>forensic phonetics</strong>, and then moved towards <strong>human-computer interaction</strong> (HCI).

Spoken HCI is now the main focus of my work as a postdoctoral researcher. As voice-activated digital assistants become a part of our daily lives, I believe it is imperative to further investigate the behavior of their human interlocutors in order to incorporate these findings into the development of the systems. Such user-centered design ensures that product development meets user expectations.

Before coming to Dublin, I was part of the <a href="http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/groups/WB/Phonetics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phonetics and Phonology</a> research group headed by <a href="http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~moebius/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Bernd Möbius</a>. The group belongs to the <a href="https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Language Science and Technology</a> department at <a href="https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saarland University</a>, Saarbrücken. During this time, I wrote my doctoral thesis on phonetic accommodation of human interlocutors in the context of human-computer interaction, which I worked on as part of the <a href="https://ioonaa.github.io/chicproject/">CHIC project</a>.
