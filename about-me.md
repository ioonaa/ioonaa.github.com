<p>
In the course of my education as a phonetician, I was engaged in various fields of application. Having a background in Romance studies, I started with the phonetics of <strong>foreign language learning</strong>, continued in the area of <strong>forensic phonetics</strong>, and am now working on <strong>phonetic accommodation in human-computer interaction</strong>. As spoken dialogue systems are becoming a part of our daily life, it is imperative to further explore the behavior of their human interlocutor.
