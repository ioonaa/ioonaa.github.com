This research project is concerned with phonetic convergence in human-computer interaction. It is funded by the DFG (2016-2020) and led by <strong>Bernd Möbius</strong> (Saarland University) and <strong>Ingmar Steiner</strong> (audEERING GmbH). The CHIC team further consists of research assistants <strong>Eran Raveh</strong> (Saarland University) and <strong>Iona Gessinger</strong> (Saarland University).

Phonetic convergence denotes an increase in similarity of the speech patterns of two interlocutors in communicative interaction. This phenomenon has been found and studied thoroughly in human-human interaction. There is now an increased interest to explore phonetic convergence in human-computer interaction (HCI) as well, since spoken dialogue system are becoming more and more integrated in our everyday life.

In the first year of funding we have demonstrated that human experimental subjects show patterns of phonetic convergence when being exposed to synthetic voices that are similar to the convergence patterns observed in human-human interaction.

In the second funding phase the project aims to extend the experimental approach to a Wizard-of-Oz scenario, develop a quantitative model of phonetic convergence in spoken HCI, build synthetic voices that are capable of adapting their speech output to the user's speech patterns, and derive implications for the design of conversational interfaces in speech technology.
